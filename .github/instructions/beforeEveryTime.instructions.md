Use DRY principle 
Use SOLID Principles

Use standard naming conventions for files
Use standard project structure for backend code.

You can delete files and folders if needed to follow standard project structure.

We will use feature folder structure.

Use the theme provided in config/theme.js for styling


In the feature folder structure you can import only from the feature folder or from shared folder

So feature can't import from other feature folders directly


Before creating new function check in the features if the function already exists
