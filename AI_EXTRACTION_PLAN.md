Let's plan something but dont impliment it until i tell you to,

the thing is that when we create a demarche we want to see the required documents from the model then we compere them to the documents we have using ai so that if we have a document that could replace another document like for exemple :

if the model requires a "ID" but we dont have but we have a "Passpport" then ai gives the the user the passport 

we feet the ai with documents we have and the model requirements and ask it to find the documents that must be given for this demarche and if there is a missing document to search for a replacement.
